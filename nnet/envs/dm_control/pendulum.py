    Pendulum (dim(S)=2, dim(A)=1, dim(O)=3): The classic inverted pendulum. 
    The torque-limited actuator is 1/6th as strong as required to lift the mass from motionless horizontal, necessitating several swings to swing up and balance. 
    The swingup task has a simple sparse reward: 1 when the pole is within 30Â° of the vertical and 0 otherwise.
